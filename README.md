A Unity package with a collection of various miscellaneous features, functions and tools. 
This package is currently mainly developed for my own needs, but if you're interested in something in it feel free to use it.

Should be compatible down to Unity 2021.3, possibly older without the SceneReference class. 
Everything is constantly WIP, so expect things to occasionally break/change between versions.
