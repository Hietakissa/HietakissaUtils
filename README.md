A Unity package with a collection of various miscellaneous features, functions and tools. 
This package is currently mainly developed for my own needs, but if you're interested in something in it feel free to use it.

Should be compatible at least down to Unity 2021.3, possibly older, but no promises. 
Everything is constantly WIP, so expect things to occasionally break/change between versions.

To install simply open the Unity Package Manager, and 'Add package from git URL...' with 'https://github.com/Hietakissa/HietakissaUtils.git'.
